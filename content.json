Very interesting...  11.7 Miriam really liked her job – it was very interesting. I worked from home, so I was with the children a lot and I loved it. In general, life was good. It was cheap – cheaper than in the UK. We joined a sports club, where the children learned to swim, and I played a lot of tennis, one of my favorite sports. The people in Durham were very friendly. They often invited us to their homes. It was easy to meet people at the sports club, or at the university where Miriam worked. And there were so many new places to see! On weekends, we visited some of the beautiful national parks. They were very different from English parks! In one park there was a sign saying “don’t disturb the snakes” – Sacha loved it! I also remember a trip to a country music festival at a blueberry farm. It was fantastic. First we listened to the music, and then we picked a lot of blueberries – they’re Elena’s favorite fruit. But after that trip she didn’t want to eat a blueberry for at least two weeks! We stayed in Durham for a year. After that we returned to England because my wife’s job finished. But we loved our life in the US, and we’re thinking of going back there in maybe two or three years. Interviewer  But, in general, you’re happy? Neah  Oh, yes. And when my internship ends, they say I can work here in the summer. That’s great for me. I really like working in a clothes store. Interviewer  What do you wear at work?
